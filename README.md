This is a program I wrote in assembly language for running on a small 16 bit processor.

The program mainly enables various kind of interactions with the peripherals of the board supplied.
By interactions, I mean,
<ul>
<li> Showing words on the small display. </li>
<li> When pressed a button, it can show various light patterns or play some tones. </li>
<li> It also had a button for playing a music using various notes. </li>
</ul>

Everything, patterns, tones and the music was hard coded as it was a primitive processor with very limited instructions and capabilities.
